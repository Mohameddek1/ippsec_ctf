1. bit-flipping attack --> is a cryptographic attack where an attacker manipulates ciphertext to control how it decrypts into plaintext, even without knowing the encryption key. Itâ€™s most effective in encryption schemes that are vulnerable to bit-level manipulation, like AES-CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode.

2. padding oracle attack 
    - Finding a padding oracle involves testing how a system responds when invalid or tampered ciphertexts are sent. A system that leaks information about whether the padding is valid or invalid is vulnerable to a padding oracle attack.
    - perl padBuster.pl --> to attack the padding oracle
    - indicators:
        - Explicit Error Messages:
            E.g., Invalid padding, Decryption failed, Bad padding.
        - Behavioral Differences:
            Different HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 for invalid padding, 200 for valid padding).
        - Encrypted Tokens:
            Modify a ciphertext token and see if the server reacts differently.

3. path hijacking in linux --> is a technique that allows an attacker to hijack the path of a packet, which can be used to redirect the packet to a different destination.
- e.g. create fake cat, 
- then export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH, 
- echo $PATH,
