# File Integrity and Corruption Detection

## Steps to Check if a File is Corrupted

### 1. Verify Checksum Using Hashes
- Use a hashing tool like `md5sum` or `sha256sum` to compute the file's hash.
- Compare the computed hash with the trusted hash provided by the source.

**Example**:
```bash
md5sum filename
sha256sum filename

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Steps to Compare Two Source Code Versions
1. Generate MD5 Checksums for Each File

For both versions (e.g., version_latest and version_old), compute the MD5 hashes of all files:

cd version_latest
find . -type f -exec md5sum {} \; > ../latest_checksums.md5

cd ../version_old
find . -type f -exec md5sum {} \; > ../old_checksums.md5

    - The find command computes the hash of all files in the directory and its subdirectories.
    - The md5sum output is saved in files latest_checksums.md5 and old_checksums.md5.

2. Compare the Checksum Files

Compare the two checksum files to identify which files have changed, been added, or removed:

diff -u old_checksums.md5 latest_checksums.md5

    - Files that differ will be shown in the output.
    - Lines starting with - are from the old version, and lines starting with + are from the latest version.
